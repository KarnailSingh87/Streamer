// src/lib/player/types.ts — the contract every playback engine implements.
//
// WHY AN ADAPTER LAYER
// -------------------
// Streamer plays video from three very different places and the control UI must
// not care which one is active:
//
//   'html5'   first-party <video> (progressive MP4/WebM, or HLS via hls.js /
//             native Safari). Full control: seek, rate, audio tracks, captions.
//   'youtube' a TMDB trailer through the YouTube IFrame API. Cross-origin, but
//             YouTube exposes a real command API, so almost everything works.
//   'embed'   a third-party streaming provider in a plain <iframe>. Same-origin
//             policy means we can read and set NOTHING inside it.
//
// The UI therefore renders from `PlayerCapabilities`, never from the engine id.
// A control whose capability is false is not rendered as a dead button — it is
// either omitted or replaced by an explanation (see TracksMenu / SeekBar).
// This is the honest alternative to faking a seek bar over an iframe.
